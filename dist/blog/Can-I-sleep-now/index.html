      <div id="blog"><p id="para_0_original">It's hard to imagine that I graduated on a random Thursday at 5:32 pm, I couldn't understand what had happened up until now
So here it is, I GRADUATED FROM ENGINEERING COLLEGE!.  79 subjects in 4 years, unprepared exams and sleepless nights is the only thing that I can recall. Now I'm starting my journey as a Software Engineer... To the 16-year-old me, who was desperately struggling to cope with everything so much so that he cried in his sleep because he just didn't want to wake up to that life; the place where I'm at right now, validates all that you had to go through. If I could, I would just hug you &amp; tell you that surprisingly, the seemingly unending tunnel does end one day &amp; you will actually get sunshine &amp; rainbows too...Cheesy, right? yes, it is. I once got asked this question and couldn't answer it, but I think I can answer that now. What is Engineering to me, well as Vaas once said " Did I ever tell you what the definition of insanity is? Insanity is doing the exact... same fucking thing... over and over again expecting... shit to change... That. Is. Crazy."
and I'm here to validate all of you who are questioning if the years of struggle are worth it. Even up until last month I felt like I'd failed at being an Engineer but then my efforts bore fruit &amp; though it was frustrating &amp; gut-wrenching when the pandemic hit, I picked myself up again as I've always had! I'm also here to say that the Indian society demeans Engineering too much. Only if they knew the efforts we put in &amp; the emotional trauma &amp; the sleepless nights we put up with to get where we are...
SO MUCH blood, sweat &amp; tears literally went into these 6 years. I'm so unimaginably grateful for where I am now. Most importantly, I'm happy, the relieved kind of happy. These 4 years taught me to live once again &amp; to the system that was traumatizing,
you couldn't break me :)</p></div>
