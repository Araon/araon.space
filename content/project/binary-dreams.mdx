Have you ever encountered art so captivating that it demands you to pause, immersing yourself in its awe-inspiring beauty?

## Tech
I used a different approach by managing state using the url, so users can share artworks in the exact state of there progress.
This allows users to share artworks precisely in the state of their progress.

Portals were utilized for rendering share modals, with Jotai facilitating the seamless management of modal states.

Contentlayer was used to validate and transform the post/stories content into type-safe JSON data. This is been a very handy tool.

Hats off to Ishan for dropping these mind-bending visuals, straight out of the Midjourney magic on his Twitter¹.
