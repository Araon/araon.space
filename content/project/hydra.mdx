## Introduction
In today's world, where computational demands are constantly increasing, the need for efficient and scalable task scheduling systems has become paramount. Hydra is a distributed task scheduler designed to handle high volumes of tasks across multiple workers, making it an ideal solution for running distributed computations on a cluster of devices, such as Raspberry Pis.\
The motivation behind Hydra stems from the challenges faced when running computationally intensive tasks on resource-constrained devices like Raspberry Pis. By distributing the workload across multiple devices, Hydra enables efficient utilization of available resources, leading to faster execution times and improved overall performance.
### Architecture Overview
Hydra follows a modular architecture, consisting of four main components:

- Scheduler: A Flask application that provides a RESTful API for scheduling tasks and retrieving their status.
- Coordinator: Another Flask application responsible for managing tasks, registering workers, and distributing tasks for execution.
- Worker: A Go application that executes assigned tasks, updates their status, and sends heartbeats to the Coordinator.
- Database: A PostgreSQL database for storing task details and aiding in task management.

## Running Hydra Locally ðŸ’»
create a .env file with the following details
```bash
POSTGRES_DB=
POSTGRES_USER=
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=
```
and then run the following command to build and run using docker

```bash
docker compose up --scale worker=3
```

## Raspberry Pi Integration
Hydra is designed to seamlessly integrate with Raspberry Pis, allowing you to leverage the combined computational power of multiple devices. To run Hydra on Raspberry Pis, you'll need to install the required dependencies (Python, Golang, PostgreSQL) and deploy the Worker component on each device.\
One potential challenge when running Hydra on Raspberry Pis is the limited resources available on these devices. To mitigate this, Hydra employs efficient task distribution and load balancing strategies, ensuring that tasks are assigned to available workers in a balanced manner.
### Task Distribution and Load Balancing
The Coordinator component in Hydra is responsible for distributing tasks to available workers using a round-robin scheduling algorithm. This approach ensures that tasks are evenly distributed across all registered workers, preventing any single worker from becoming overwhelmed.
Additionally, the Coordinator periodically fetches tasks scheduled to run within the next 30 seconds and assigns them to available workers. This proactive approach ensures that workers always have tasks to execute, maximizing resource utilization.
### Fault Tolerance and Scalability
Hydra is designed with fault tolerance and scalability in mind. The Coordinator monitors worker availability through periodic heartbeats, automatically unregistering workers that fail to respond. This mechanism ensures that tasks are not assigned to unresponsive or failed workers, improving overall system reliability.
Scalability is achieved by allowing new workers to be dynamically added or removed from the system. As more computational resources become available (e.g., additional Raspberry Pis), Hydra can automatically distribute tasks across the expanded worker pool, leveraging the increased computing power.
### Example Use Case: Distributed Image Processing
One practical use case for Hydra on Raspberry Pis is distributed image processing. Imagine you have a large collection of images that need to be processed (e.g., resizing, filtering, or applying machine learning models). By breaking down the image processing tasks and distributing them across multiple Raspberry Pis using Hydra, you can significantly reduce the overall processing time.
### Performance Considerations
When running Hydra on resource-constrained devices like Raspberry Pis, performance optimizations become crucial. Hydra is designed with efficiency in mind, leveraging lightweight technologies (Flask, Golang) and optimized communication protocols (HTTPS) to minimize overhead.
Additionally, Hydra employs efficient task distribution and load balancing strategies to ensure that tasks are evenly distributed across available workers, preventing resource bottlenecks and maximizing utilization.
### Future Enhancements
While Hydra already offers a robust and scalable task scheduling solution, several future enhancements are planned to further improve its capabilities:

- Task Prioritization: Implementing task prioritization mechanisms to ensure that critical tasks are executed first, based on user-defined priorities.
- Advanced Scheduling Algorithms: Exploring more advanced scheduling algorithms, such as task affinity or resource-aware scheduling, to optimize task assignment based on specific requirements or resource constraints.
- Resource Monitoring and Allocation: Integrating resource monitoring and allocation strategies to dynamically adjust task distribution based on the available resources on each worker.

### Below are the endpoints avaliable
```bash
POST /schedule
{
   "command":"./run_cleanup.sh",
   "scheduled_at": ""
}
```

Schedule a new task. The request body should be a JSON object with a command and a scheduled_at field. The scheduled_at should be in ISO format.

```bash
GET /schedule/<task_id>
```
Retrieve a task status by its ID.
