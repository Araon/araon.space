In the aftermath of the two powerful cyclones that struck West Bengal, I embarked on a project to visualize their progression using satellite imagery. The goal was to create a mesmerizing timelapse video that would capture the cyclones' formation and movement across the region.

The source of the data was [MOSDAC](https://www.mosdac.gov.in/) (Meteorological and Oceanographic Satellite Data Archival Centre), an invaluable resource for satellite imagery and data. MOSDAC publishes live images and data captured by Indian geostationary satellites like [INSAT-3D](https://www.isro.gov.in/INSAT_3D.html) and [INSAT-3DR](https://www.isro.gov.in/INSAT_3DR.html) on a daily basis. This wealth of information is a goldmine for researchers, meteorologists, and data enthusiasts alike.

To obtain the necessary data, I developed a Python script to scrape MOSDAC's publicly available image gallery. Over the course of 30 days, the script downloaded and archived over 550 individual satellite images, each providing a snapshot of the cyclones' evolution.

The resulting timelapse offers a unique perspective on the cyclones' progression:

As the timelapse unfolds, you can witness the cyclones taking shape and their paths across the Indian peninsula. The sun's reflection on the ocean, moving from right to left, serves as a natural indicator of time, allowing you to track the passage of days effortlessly.

Here's a glimpse into the code used to scrape the images from MOSDAC's website:
```Python
def download_images(sat_id, month):
    ...
    for day in range(1, 32):
        found_image = False
        ...
        for time in time_list:
            link = f"https://mosdac.gov.in/.../3DIMG_{day+month+year}_{time}_{sat_id}.jpg"
            response = requests.get(link, stream=True)
            if response.ok:
                with open(f"images/{day}-{time}.jpg", "wb") as f:
                    f.write(response.content)
                print(f"Image found: {day}-{time}")
                found_image = True
        
        if not found_image:
            print(f"No image on {year}-{month}-{day}")
```
Once the images were downloaded, I utilized OpenCV to stitch them together into a seamless timelapse video:
```Python
def generate_video(path, filename, fps=25):
    ...
    out = cv2.VideoWriter(filename, cv2.VideoWriter_fourcc(*'DIVX'), fps, size)
    for i, img in enumerate(images):
        out.write(img)
    out.release()
```

### Future enhancements
- Daily Wallpaper Generation:
One fascinating extension could be to generate daily wallpapers or backgrounds based on the satellite imagery from MOSDAC. Instead of creating a timelapse video, the script could download the latest satellite image each day and process it to create a visually appealing wallpaper. These wallpapers could showcase various meteorological and geographical features captured by the satellites, providing a unique and ever-changing backdrop for users' devices.
- Local Rain Prediction:
Leveraging the wealth of data available from MOSDAC, it might be possible to develop a localized rain prediction system. By analyzing patterns in the satellite imagery, cloud formations, temperature gradients, and other relevant data, a machine learning model could be trained to forecast the likelihood of precipitation in specific regions. This could be particularly useful for agricultural purposes, disaster preparedness, or even personal planning.
