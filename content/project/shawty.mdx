A very light url shortner with expiration support
It takes in a long url like `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpUuuT_EzSs` and return something like `https://biturl.top/zE3YBr`

This is mainly solution from this coding challenge [Write Your Own URL Shortener](https://codingchallenges.fyi/challenges/challenge-url-shortener)

Below are the endpoint is present

[POST]/short
request
```json
{
    "url":"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects",
    "expire":"2022-10-05T14:48:00.000Z"
}
```
response
```json
{
    "key": "79f292",
    "long_url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects",
    "short_url": "http://localhost:4000/short/79f292",
    "expire": "2022-10-05T14:48:00.000Z"
}
```

When the short url is hit ,it redirected using 302 HTTP status code
