# Prologue

Imagine you have your main branch with **commits A&B**. Now, what you need to do
is create a feature branch. This feature branch will have **commits C&D**.

Unfortunately, you’ve been watching a bit too much YouTube and your coworker
beats you with **commit E**, that’s now on the main branch or the trunk.

What you want to do is use git rebase on your branch to rebase or change the
base to incorporate the new commits from the main branch. This action will
modify your **commits to be C' and D'**.

However, now you'll be able to test with the current situation on the main
branch. Once you're done with testing, you can merge those changes, resulting in
a correct history of your development without any unsightly merge commits either
within the branch or as you move back to the main branch.

Git merge creates a new commit that combines changes from both the feature
branch and the main branch. Imagine you start working on a feature while others
are also adding to the main branch. When you’re ready to put your changes into
the main branch, a merge commit blends your work with the main branch.

On the other hand, git rebase works by moving your feature branch’s changes to
the end of the main branch’s latest commits. This makes the history look
straight and tidy, with no extra merge commits.

**Rebasing:**
- Provides a cleaner history.
- Creates a more readable graph.
- Can be tougher to resolve conflicts.

**Merging:**
- Preserves history.
- Is better for handling merge conflicts.
- Is easy to undo if needed.
