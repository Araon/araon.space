Six months had already passed, and I can say that the greatest achievement I had done—so far—is to wake up each day and stay still, despite having many reasons to give up. There are days that sadness weighs heavier than myself, but I chose not to be swayed by the thought of letting it dragged me down—instead, I dragged my own feet to keep on going. I've had my share of this life's breakdown and downfall. And each time it happens, I learnt to stand back up stronger with the notion in my head that this might happen again—but by that time, we know how to deal with it better than before. It's all fine to face it again and again—that's just how life is—but i can't let melancholy win over me now; I've had enough of grief and pain.
