I snuck out a few years ago and met with my best friend. We ran away together and watched
the stars for hours. It was freezing but I was high on adrenaline. We laughed together on the grass and told
stories while looking at the stars. They looked so beautiful.

She walked me home and neither of us got caught by our parents. I loved that night and I think about it almost
every day it was so magical. We always said we’d sneak out again and go back to that park but we never did.

It’s been two years since she died and I never went near that park until recently. I went in the dead of night
and sat there looking at the same stars we did all those years ago. They were still there but she wasn’t. I
guess I can only hope she was watching them with me.

I can’t wait for the day we finally stargaze there again.
