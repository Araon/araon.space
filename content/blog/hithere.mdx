Iâ€™m just a dude who decided to make a website to document his life. Iâ€™m not all that special, successful,
interesting, or brilliant, though others say otherwise. (They would.)
I was not prompted to challenge myself academically as a pupil. I did what was required to get a top mark and no
more; grades were all that mattered, however arbitrary they may be.
I did not partake in extracurriculars besides sportsâ€”which I was encouraged to pursue, against all sensible
logic, despite being perpetually among the tallest of my class. Sports are where young men (and women) attempt
to destroy other young men (and women) for no reason other than machismo and school spirit and sports.
I was not constituted for the endeavor, and even if I was, Iâ€™d still feel the repercussions of battle
I was a ghost through college, which I attended absentmindedly and virtually compulsorily with no intentions or
prudence other than to take the easiest courses possible and involve myself no more than physically or mentally
required.

Well The competition i was avoiding for so long in sport resurfaced as a dogfight for grade points, cutthroat
educational warfare


So: Hi. <b>Iâ€™m Araon.</b>
My full name is Soumik Ghosh, but I go by Araon for short. Araon has a nice ring.
Youâ€™ll probably remember it

I was raised in a middle-class suburb of Kolkata. It floods during the rainy seasons, the
local playgrounds are good, and most young residents donâ€™t realize how good they have it. Opportunityâ€™s
overwhelming.

I spent my teens absorbed in trivial, introverted pursuits that hindered my ability to speak up and as a result
I feel Iâ€™m behind the bar. I fear I will ever catch up.

### Why I Blog?

> to change.

This is nothing more than a mirror. It reflects whateverâ€™s been gunked in my mind and
impossible to fully grasp otherwise.
The stretches during which Iâ€™ve not regularly divulged my running thoughts, through this medium or another, have
been the most sclerotic and self-oblivious of my life
Sometimes i'll have guest posts by some of my friends, they'll give a diffrent theme, concept and god forbid
even an opinion on things on and around the world
